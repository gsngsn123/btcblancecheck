Checkbalance is a quick and dirty Java programm for The Ferox [1].
It does not handle any exceptions. I tested it on both Win and Linux
and had no problems. If its not working for you the zip file
contains the source. Sorry, no warranty.

The addresses must be seperated by a linebreak in a file named
in.txt in the same directory, the output will be in out.txt
ANY EXISTING out.txt WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!

There are example files (using win linebreak) to help understand the format.

Run with:
java -jar chkblnc.jar
from console/terminal

If you found this helpfull, feel free to donate a few Satoshi to
